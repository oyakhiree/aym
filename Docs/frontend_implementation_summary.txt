AYM CONNECT FRONTEND DEMO - IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTATION
======================================================
Date: 2026-01-09
Version: 1.0.0 (Demo)

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
This document details the initialization and implementation of the "AYM Connect" frontend demo. 
The project is a high-fidelity, mobile-first web application designed for managing Adventist Youth Ministry activities. 
As per the revised requirements, the tech stack was shifted from Next.js to Vue.js 3 to better suit the specific engineering preferences for this phase.

2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------
A. Tech Stack
   - Framework: Vue.js 3 (Composition API)
   - Build Tool: Vite (for rapid development and optimized builds)
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS v3 (Utility-first, configured for mobile-first design)
   - State Management: Pinia (Modular stores for Auth, Club, Education)
   - Routing: Vue Router 4 (Dynamic routing with meta layouts)
   - Icons: Lucide-Vue-Next (Modern, consistant SVG icons)

   └── ...config files

3. KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
---------------------------
A. Mobile-First Design System
   - The application uses a "Mobile First" CSS approach. All layouts start as mobile and adapt to larger screens (`md:` breakpoints).
   - Navigation:
     - Mobile: Fixed Bottom Navigation Bar (Home, Members, Education, Profile).
     - Desktop: Fixed Left Sidebar navigation.
   - Touch Targets: Buttons and inputs are sized (min 44px) for comfortable touch interaction.

B. Authentication Module
   - Simulated Authentication using `authStore`.
   - Login View with role selection (Mock: Club Director, Super Admin, etc.).
   - Protected Routes: Global navigation guard redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.

C. Club Management Module
   - Dashboard: Visual cards displaying club metrics (Active Members, etc.).
   - Member List: responsive view that switches between "Card Grid" on mobile and "Data Table" on desktop.
   - Member Details: extensive profile view with "Edit Mode" to modify bio-data.
   - Status Toggling: Real-time (mock) status updates (Active/Inactive) with visual feedback.

D. Educational Management Module
   - Class List: Overview of Active Progressive and Honour classes.
   - Class Details/Attendance: Interface for instructors to view student lists and toggle daily attendance.

4. ENGINEERING STANDARDS APPLIED
--------------------------------
- **Component Reusability**: UI elements like Cards, Buttons, and Inputs are abstracted into `src/components/ui` to ensure consistency.
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility is maintained (Views handle layout, Stores handle logic/data, Components handle UI presentation).
- **Clean Code**: Codebase is breathable, utilizing modern JavaScript (ES6+) and Vue 3 Composition API features (script setup).
- **Scalability**: The directory structure allows for easy addition of new modules (e.g., Reports, Exam System) without cluttering existing folders.

5. SETUP & RUN INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd "c:\Work\AYM Connect\frontend"

2. Install Dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run Development Server:
   npm run dev

4. Build for Production:
   npm run build

6. FUTURE ROADMAP (PENDING)
---------------------------
- Integration with Nest.js backend (replacing mock stores).
- Implementation of the "Exam System" logic.
- Real file uploads for Birth Certificates (Supabase Storage integration).
- Conference/Area level dashboards.
